## 🌍 How Groups Were Ranked (Methodology)

The ranking of groups is based on a **composite threat assessment**, considering multiple dimensions beyond just fighter numbers.

| Factor | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Global Threat Impact** | Influence on international security, including global recruitment and operations. |
| **Strategic Importance** | Control over territory, resources, political influence. |
| **State Sponsorship** | Support by nation-states, enhancing operational strength. |
| **Operational Capability** | Sophistication and scale of attacks. |
| **Transnational Activity** | Ability to operate across multiple regions and borders. |
| **Longevity and Resilience** | Survival through military pressure and leadership losses. |
| **Affiliations and Networks** | Ties to global terror movements (Al-Qaeda, ISIS, etc.). |
| **Propaganda and Influence Operations** | Ability to radicalize and inspire globally. |

📌 **Note:**  
- Estimated strength (fighter numbers) was a **secondary factor**.
- Groups with **smaller size** but **greater global impact** were ranked appropriately higher than purely local insurgencies.
